### Integrating Zoom Meeting/Webinar registration to custom form pages

#### Use Case

- You have a single-page form that
  uses [Wagtail Form Builder](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/latest/reference/contrib/forms/).
- You use the form builder to build custom form pages for collecting user information, say registrants to a
  workshop/event.
- You use Zoom as the video conferencing solution.
- You want to add users who register for your event, from your website, to the Zoom Meeting/Webinar, and you want Zoom
  to manage sending your registrants meeting and follow-up emails

You can follow the following snippet to achieve the above:

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models
from modelcluster.fields import ParentalKey
from wagtail.admin.panels import InlinePanel
from wagtail.contrib.forms.models import AbstractFormField
from wagtail.models import Page

from wagtailzoom.models import AbstractZoomIntegrationForm


class HomePage(Page):
    pass


class FormField(AbstractFormField):
    page = ParentalKey('EventRegistrationPage', on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='form_fields')


class EventRegistrationPage(AbstractZoomIntegrationForm):
    parent_pages = ["home.HomePage"]
    template = 'event_registration_page.html'
    landing_page_template = 'form_thank_you_landing.html'

    content_panels = Page.content_panels + AbstractZoomIntegrationForm.integration_panels + [
        InlinePanel('form_fields', label="Form fields"),
    ]

```

You can find this code snippet implemented in `sandbox/home/models.py`

Run your migrations, and create the page from the Wagtail Admin Explorer.

The editor form will look similar to below:

![Sample Event](screenshots/sample_event.png)

1. Select the Zoom Event you want to integrate. This is a dropdown of the latest meetings and webinars created
2. Create your form fields, according to the information you want to collect from your registrants. The fields that must
   be included are:
    - Email - with field type `email`
    - First Name - with field type `single line text`
    - Last Name - with field type `single line text`

Save and `Publish` your page.

Go back to the Wagtail Admin Explorer, and locate where the page you created is listed. Hover around the page title, and
you will see a button named `Zoom Integration` as below

![Zoom Integration Button](screenshots/zoom_integration_button.png)

Click it, and it will open a page, where you will match the Zoom required form fields `(Email, First Name, Last Name)`,
with the fields in your form.

![Zoom Integration Form](screenshots/zoom_intergation_form.png)

Make sure you do the matching correctly as this will inform Zoom on how to extract the required user data from your
Custom form. If not set, or not correctly set, the integration will not work.

Save the integration form.

If done correctly, new registrants will be added to Zoom on submission of the form page.

You can try adding a user to make sure everything works, before sharing your page with your users.
